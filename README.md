# Effect of Shall-Carry Law on Violence Rate in United-States.

A Shall-issue law is one that requires that governments issue concealed carry handgun permits to any applicant who meets the necessary criteria. The second amendment of the United States Constitution protects the right to keep and bear arms which is also known as shall carry law. Many states in the United States have passed the right to carry laws. The eligibility criteria to be issued the license is as follows:
1. The person should be mentally stable
2. Have no criminal history in the past
3. Successfully completion of a course in firearms training (as per the law)

But, the key question that we are trying to answer here is, "Do the shall-carry law's inclusion reduces crime / violence rate in a state or not?"

## General Info
The data set is a balanced panel of data on 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia (for a total of 51 “states”), by year for 1977 – 1999. Each observation is a given state in a given year. There are a total of 51 states × 23 years = 1173 observations. The study first covers the descriptive analysis followed by predictive analysis. The inclusion or exclusion of the variables in the models is supported by the economic theory and the significance of the variable.
